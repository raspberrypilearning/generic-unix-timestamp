Unix timestamps are a convenient way to store a date and time as a single number. 

A Unix timestamp is the number of seconds since 1 January 1970 in UTC (an international standard for time). For example, `1498734934` is 29 June 2017 at 11:15am. 

You can find the current Unix timestamp at [unixtimestamp.com](http://www.unixtimestamp.com/).
